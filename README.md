# multi-scale-modeling

Project deals with the problem of multi-scale modeling as simulations of grain growth using cellular automata

The project includes a class responsible for the course of the simulation and a gui module

2 types of neighborhood have been implemented: 
* Moore neighborhood  
* hexagonal left neighborhood

Additionally, a function for periodic boundary conditions has been implemented
Project includes grain growth by Monte Carlo method and an algorithm for static recrystallization

An important element is also the module for generating the microstructure in the area defined by the image scan

The simulation result is displayed as a new window and saved as a .jpg image
